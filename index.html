                <strong>Supply Chain Dashboard:</strong> Developed a consolidated dashboard that tracked historical and real-time shipments, analyzed container utilization, and monitored travel days. This comprehensive dashboard provided valuable insights into the supply chain operations, enabling better logistics planning and resource allocation.

                <strong>Cluster Analysis and Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Leveraged my expertise in cluster analysis and personalized recommendations to create a robust cosine similarity-based recommendation system for SKUs (Stock Keeping Units). The system efficiently generated the top 10 recommendations with corresponding scores, empowering stock optimization and enhancing customer product suggestions, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and inventory management.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Style-Level Sales Prediction:</strong> Successfully created a proof of concept for style-level sales prediction over the next 9 weeks using historical sales data. To achieve this, I implemented and compared various forecasting models, including ARIMA, Prophet, and three different LSTM architectures. The deep learning model demonstrated the best performance based on the least Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), allowing for more accurate sales forecasts and better inventory planning.
